# Just Pick Something! 
Meal planning app, made for learning all the Vue things but also meal planning.

The inspiration behind this app is how easy it is to engage my spouse in meal planning with the Home Chef app. Stuff like that helps him help me. As I thought about it, I think this app could be useful for folks who are non-verbal, or maybe just digest information better with pictures than text.


## Current State
- using Cosmic.js for CMS
- stuck: unsure if Vuex, Cosmic JS, or me. 
- Cosmic returns 'undefined' in cosmic-cli when I try to target my bucket slug

## Note on Styles
Uses Vuetify 3, which is is alpha, as well as hand-rolled styles. Will refactor for Vuetify components as they are released.
